# jd-zoom

Zoom-in for images.

- Simple
- No bullshit in the DOM. Just your image and a container.
- Plain old scale and translate.
- Because of that, it is smooth af.
- Scales the image to 100%, display scaling aware
- Super high resolution screen or image already big enough? Forces to a fallback scaling ratio
- AND SUPER COOL ZOOM-IN ANIMATION. IT JUST MAKES SENSE.

Caveats:

- No mobile support. Only desktop. At least for now.

jd because I was listening to Joy Division when I thought about the name.
