# jd-zoom

Zoom-in for images.

- Simple
- Minimal DOM requirements. Just your image and a container.
- Relies on CSS transform functions â€” scale and translate.
- Because of that, it is smooth af.
- Scales the image to 100% their resolution, display scaling aware. Crisp images as they should.
- Super high resolution screen or image already big enough? Forces to a fallback scaling ratio.
- WITH A COOL ZOOM-IN ANIMATION THAT MAKES SENSE.

Caveats:

- No mobile support. Only desktop. At least for now. I may have to use [hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) to make it work.

jd because I was listening to Joy Division when I thought about the name.
